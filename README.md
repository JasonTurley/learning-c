# Learning C

This repository contains code snippets and demonstrations I've created while learning the C programming language. It's not meant to serve as a structured roadmap for others studying Câ€”rather, it's simply a personal archive to track my own progress and experiments.

Some of the resources I'm using to guide my learning include:

* K&R's *The C Programming Language*
* UIUC CS 241 [Systems Programming Wikibook](https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki) (now CS 341 [coursebook](https://cs341.cs.illinois.edu/coursebook/))
* [Learning C by h0mbre](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C)
